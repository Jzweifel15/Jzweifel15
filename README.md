**`Software Artisan (Developer)`**

### A Little About Me
Currently, I am an IT Support Technician II for Amazon and I'm looking to get into a software development/engineering position. I have recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Western Governors University. I like to solve problems build full-stack web applications and all projects I've built have been from the ground up, from requirements analysis and design, all the way to testing and deployment. Recently, I have found a knack for artificial intelligence and machine learning as I believe this is the future of technology.
